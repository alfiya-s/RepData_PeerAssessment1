## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
require(ggplot2, data.table)
DT <- read.csv(unz('activity.zip', 'activity.csv'))
DT$date <- as.Date(DT$date, '%Y-%M-%d')
DT <- data.table(DT)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
DT.steps <- DT[, .(steps = sum(steps, na.rm = T)), by = date]
DT.steps
qplot(data = DT.steps, 
      DT.steps$steps, 
      breaks = seq(0, 35000, by = 5000),
      xlab = 'Nuber of Steps',
      ylab = 'Frequency', 
      main = 'Distribution of number of steps taken per day')
mean(DT.steps$steps)
median(DT.steps$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
